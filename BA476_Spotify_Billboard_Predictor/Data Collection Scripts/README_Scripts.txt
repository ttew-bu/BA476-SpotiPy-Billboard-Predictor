The Spotify extractor takes a CSV full of spotify URIs 
and adds additional attributes to the songs by using lists and a dataframe.
Adding new features should not be too bad- if there's useful data that Spotipy
can yield in future iterations or if certain things should be changed
(maybe full release date gets pulled instead of just the month), go for it!
