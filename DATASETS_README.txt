Manipulated Data is the result of our data manipulation workbook; it is 
our dataset after we removed outliers, but has not yet been standardized
with StandardScaler (that step occurs in the models notebooks).

New_spotify is the input to our data manipulation workbook; it is the result
of the Kaggle dataset plus our collection script. 

dataset-of-10s is the original set that was taken from Kaggle and fed into 
our scraping script; there are many different decades to try if this
project interests you.
